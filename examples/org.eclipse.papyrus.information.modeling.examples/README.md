## ProjectManagement

This project contains an example model for demonstrating the use of the subset of UML that is available in the *Papyrus Information Modeling* product. The goal is to showcase

* the modeling of packages and their relationships in terms of imports,
* the use of classes, attributes, enumerations, and associations,
* the definition of own data types and their use in attributes,
* how one model can be represented in multiple diagrams,
* how hyperlinks can be set to easily navigate between diagrams, and
* how to load and use models that are located in different model files.
