This short guide introduces you to the basic concepts necessary to create a UML model with a class diagram in Papyrus Information Modeling.

         title="Open Papyrus Perspective">
      <description>
First, open the Papyrus perspective. This perspective is already configured with the most common views to support you in viewing, creating, and modifying UML models.

      <command
            required="true"
            serialization="org.eclipse.ui.perspectives.showPerspective(org.eclipse.ui.perspectives.showPerspective.perspectiveId=org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.perspective)"/>

         title="Create new Papyrus Project">
      <description>
All UML models must be contained in a project. The Papyrus project wizard allows you to initialize a project with a UML model and opens the respective model editor.

   	<description>
<p>Please take a short time to familiarize with the UI. Besides the editor area in the center, the most important views are:</p>
<p><b>Project Explorer:</b> Shows a list of all your projects and files.</p>
<p><b>Model Explorer:</b> Shows the content of the currently opened UML model.</p>
<p><b>Properties:</b> Shows the properties of the currently selected element in the UML model.</p>

<p>Initially, the UML model only contains a Model element with a default name. We can now add elements to this model either through the Model Explorer or by creating a UML Class Diagram and adding the elements in the visual editor.
So just select the Model element in the Model Explorer and create a UML class diagram.</p>

   <item title="Create a UML Class">
   	<description>
Finally, you can add a class to your class diagram. As you can see, the class is automatically added to the respective model and shown in the Model Explorer.
