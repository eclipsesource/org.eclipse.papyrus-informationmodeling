This plug-in contains simplifications of the Eclipse Workbench UI,
which may not be compatible with other simplifications.
Thus, the intention of this plug-in is to separate composable
from non-composable contributions.
Non-composable functionalities and simplifications are only allowed
in this plug-in and must be avoided in others.
As a result, composable functionalities should rather be located
in other plug-ins, as we will not include this plug-in when
composing multiple Papyrus DSMLs, viewpoints, etc.
